Capstone Project CoffeeRoulette

A CoffeeRoulette chooses randomly pairs of persons in a group, that will then have a coffee together.

It starts from a group of persons having answered if they want to participate to the CoffeeRoulette.
This group of persons and their answer are initially given in file: ParticipantsList.txt
The program gives a list of pairs of persons in GroupList.txt. 
If the number of persons is odd, the last group has three persons.
A file NamesList.txt is generated or updated with the participating persons 
and an history of the persons already met.
